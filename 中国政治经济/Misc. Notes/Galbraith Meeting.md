**Objective:**

- Analyze the effective policy space and toolkit available to the PBC and various other regulators in light of the 2020 property sector crisis

Reading:
How China Escaped Shock Therapy - Isabelle Weber
China's 40 Years of Economic Development - Zheng Xinli
Rise of the People's Bank of China

**Key Interests:**
1. Work on capital controls and take on the role they have played in managing the crisis
2. Central bank independence debate (?)
	- 2017 Report mentions "neutral policy stance"
	- How does this square with (Magdoff & Sweezy, 1987): The central bank acts as the executive committee of the capitalist class (Bell & Feng, 2013) showed the historical ability of the PBC to tame interest rates
	- Limitations of central bank independence indicators
	- Is comparative central-banking with a class-based focused a la Gerald Epstein (1991) a lively discussion in China?
	- (Cao Tinggui, 2001) Central bank independence is "determined by economic conditions in the final analysis, and not determined by law."
3. It is my understanding that the central bank and housing ministry orchestrated the crisis with the Three Red Lines policy in order to reduce overleveraging in the real estate sector
	- Does this imply that they were confident in their ability to manage a crisis, or that there was simply an immeidate need for mass deleveraging
4. Xi is stressing the importance of sidelining GDP as the ultimate indicator of social progress
	- What other types of indicators, or non-indicators, could we be paying attention to to get a better grasp on the big picutre?
5. Concern with the growing level of household debt? Growing capture by microfinance companies of consumer spending?

My understanding of the policy toolkit:
1. Open Market Operations
2. Reserve Requirement Ratio
3. Central bank lending and rediscount
4. Interest rate policy
5. Macroprudential policy intsruments
6. Window guidance
7. Forward guidance
