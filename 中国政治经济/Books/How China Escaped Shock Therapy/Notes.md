**Introduction**
Post-soviet collapse, the [[International Monetary Fund (IMF)]]
and [[World Bank]] introduced a comprehensive package of policies to the former soviet republics in order to "shock" the planned economies into market economies expediently

The package consisted of:
1. Liberalization of all prices in one big bang
2. Privatization
3. Trade liberalization
4. Stabilization, in the form of tight monetary and fiscal policies

Perhaps only 1 and 4 can be immediately implemented

(Lipton and Sachs, 1990) Thatcher had only overseen the privatization of a few dozen or so state enterprises, so what methods were necessary to transition this major array of state enterprises?

For the liberalizers, domestic price liberalization was a precondition for trade liberalization
- "What was presented as a comprehensive reform package turned out to be a policy that is exteremly biased toward only one element of a market economy: the market determination of prices"

Complementary macromeasures were necessary to ensure the long-term survival of price liberalization
- A one-time spike in the price level due to price liberalization would do its part in reducing the value of domestic savings and thus curtail "excessive demand"

There was little prescription for the new insitututions that should arise due to the shock therapy. It was more-or-less imagined that the destruction of the command economy would automatically give rise to a market economy

"Instead of the predicted one-time increase in the price level, Russia entered a prolonged period of very high inflation, combined with a drop in output followed by low growth rates."

China took a much different approach to price liberalization by insituting the [[中国政治经济/Policy/双轨制（Dual-Track System）/Notes|Dual-Track System]]
- As a result, prices were *gradually* determined by the market

# Part I: Modes of Market Creation and Price Regulation

## Chapter 1: Bureaucratic Market Participation
"By acknowledging a long standing, distinct market consciousness among Chinese imperial officials as well as indigenous theories of commercialization through the state, I avoid framing a move to the market as simply a trend imported from the West"

"This concept of price regulation through commercial activity of the bureaucracy is distinct from the insistence on state and market as separate entities in most areas of modern economics."

### The [[管子（Guanzi）|Guanzi's]] "Light-Heavy (轻重)" Principles of Price Regulation

During the Warring States Period, economic growth emerged as a major concern in light of constat warfare

"The guiding question in the tratment of economic issues was how to govern change in the context of the transition to a new kind of economy."

The light-heavy principles were developed to meet the aims of strengthening the state and the army

"From the perspective of 轻重, all economic pehnomena can only be understood relationally; things can be heavy or light *only in relation to other things*"

Already the [[管子（Guanzi）|Guanzi]] theorized the dual nature of scarcity in prices, in that prices relied both on the absolute quantity of goods in the market, but also about the distribution of these goods across producers.
- Furthermore, it discussed demand's role in shaping prices
- Goods which function as a store of value (价值储藏) will increase in price when people try to hold onto their wealth in some physical, nonmonetary form

"The balancing of the grain price becomes the corre of the 'art of planned fiscal management'"
- "The government has a responsibility to stabilize the price of grain in order to stabilize the overall price level and the value of money."
