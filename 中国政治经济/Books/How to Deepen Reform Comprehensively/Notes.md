[[中国共产党（Communist Party of China）|CPC]] central task is **economic development**, which is integrated with two basic points:
1. [[四项基本原则（Four Cardinal Principles）]]
2. [[改革开放（Reform and Opening Up）]]

**Comprehensively** depening reform
- here meaning the refrom must be *implemented across the board under the same guiding principles*

`p46` "We must respect praxis and creativity, encourage people to explore boldly and break new ground, open up new paths *through praxis*, and then proceed further *after we have gained experience*." (Emphasis mine)

`p53` "If one does not investigate, one has no right to speak, let alone the power to decide."

Strong focus on reform *coordination* to enhance effects
- Keep a lookout for connected reforms and be careful of viewing them in isolation

`p63` "The conservatives do not know how to accomodate to the circumstances, and the progressives do not understand the fundamental problems. Because the conservatives cannot accomodate to the circumstances, they do not have the skills necessary to thwart their enemies, and because the progressives do not understand the fundamental problems, they are susspicious of fame and learning." - 張之洞（Zhang Zhidong）

Relations of production <-> Productive forces
Superstructure <-> Economic Base

`p76` Clear goal to shape the market as an effective mechanism of resource allocation

`p77` 中共中央18th, 3rd Plenary Session
- emphasis on delineating market and government roles

p79 Market should effectively manage allocation of resources, government should:
1. Maintain economic stability
2. Strengthen and improve public services
3. Ensure fair competition
4. Strengther market oversight and supervision
5. Maintain market order
6. Spur on sustainable development
7. Promote common prosperity
8. Step in at times of **market failure**

`p83` Economic development is the central task of the whole Party precisely because the underdeveloped productive capacity of society presents major problems in meeting the ever-growing material and cultural needs of the people

`p86 `On land reform, the following must be adhered to:
1. Public ownership of land cannot be changed
2. The red line below which the quantity of arable land must not fall cannot be moved
3. Farmer's interests must not be harmed

`p129` Four key points to institutional innovation:
1. Concentrate on priorities
2. Adopt a pragmatic approach
	1. "We must never make empty promises or give the people false hopes; otherwise, we will lose their trust."
3. We must be persevering
4. Improve organizational work

"We cannot have a situation wherein the leaders are uninterested in what the people want, or wherein the people lack enthusiasm for what leaders are trying to achieve."
