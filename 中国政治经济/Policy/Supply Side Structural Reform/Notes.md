First announced in late 2015 by President [[习近平（Xi Jinping）]]

Supply-Side structural reform targets the structure of production, to make it more efficient at the macro and firm level [[chinas-supply-side-structural-reform.pdf |1]]

Five tasks of supply side structural reform:
1. Cutting industrial capacity
2. Reducing the housing inventory
3. Cutting leverage
4. Lowering corporate costs
5. Improving weak economic links

Supply-side structural reform takes into account the reality that current trends (2016) in declining investment are not a demand-side problem, but it is *a problem of overcapacity*

Five most important dialectical relationships in the modern chinese economy:
1. The relationship between supply and demand
	1. The two cannot be treated independently of one another
	2. A moderate expansion of public demand is needed, with sufficient purchasing power, in order to facilitate supply-side structural reform
2. The relationship between short-term and long-term goals
	1. Supply-side structural reforms mainly serve to solve the issue of long-term development
	2. In the short-term, monetary policy must maintain balance in the market while facilitating demand-driven momentum
	3. In the long-term, fiscal policy can prmote restructuring
3. The relationship between urban and rural development
	1. The biggest challenge in the national economy
	2. Housing prices are skyrocketing in cities, whereas farmers to not have a source of property income
	3. Should develop a total-factor market in rural areas, and promote free flow of the factors that can benefit farmers
4. The relationship between the virtual and real economy
	1. An inflated virtual economy will do harm to the real economy
	2. Must maintain moderate control over the virtual economy so that it develops in line with the real economy at a rational pace
5. Relationship between the government and the markets
	1. Must be a clear division of labor between the two
	2. The role of government:
		1. Market regulation
		2. Macro control
		3. Supply of public goods
		4. Coordnation of economic ties with other economies
	3. Markets must play a decisive role in resource allocation

From 1993 to 2013, the party organized around the market playing a fundamental role in resource allocation
- In 2013, the coinage was changed to recognize the market as playing a *decisive* role of resource allocation
- When the market is playing a decisive role, society is following the [[价值规律（Law of Value）|Law of Value]]

Supply-side scrtuctural reform eschews short-term fixes, *especially debt-driven stimulus*
